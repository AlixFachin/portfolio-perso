# Background
This project was created

## Summary

## Technologies
This project was developed in React

## What did I learn

* The RSA Algorithm
* `JNBI` library to manipulate big numbers in JavaScript
* `useReducer` React hook (when the app state is too complex to manage with `useState` but using Redux would be overkill)
