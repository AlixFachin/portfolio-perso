## Project description

The project starts from the following idea:
A lot of small restaurants are suffering from the COVID-19 crisis, and we wanted to provide an app 
to help them survive while diversifying their income by selling some products online.
In four days however it was not realistic to aim this high, so we made a MVP which allows one team to sell their products online.

## Technologies used
* On the front-end: `Vue`, `VueX` and `Vuetify`
* On the back-end: `Express.js` for our REST API and `knex.js` to connect to our `PostgresQL` database.
* Payment managed by  [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
* Authentication managed by [Auth0](https://auth0.com)
