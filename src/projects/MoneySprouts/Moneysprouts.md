MoneySprouts is a progressive web app that helps its users to **save money** and **remind them to accomplish their personal environmental goals** at the same time.
It tracks your expenses and compares those with your monthly targets, and tracks _eco-actions_, e.g. whether you used a plastic bag for 
groceries, whether you used public transport for shopping or your own car, etc...
