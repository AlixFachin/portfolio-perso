# A new website!

Hi everyone - today a quick blog post to announce the deployment of my portfolio website.
I hope you like it ðŸ˜Š

## Tech used
I wanted to build a static website quite quickly, and after looking at a few "10 best static website generators" like pages, I found out [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com).

It drew my curiosity, as it was built in `JavaScript` using `React` and it was supposed to be lightning fast.

I then spent one week and a half to get accustomed to gatsby plugins and the way the data is stored and retrieved.

All in all I am rather happy about my choice, and there is still so much to explore! (SEO, tests, ...)ðŸ’ª
