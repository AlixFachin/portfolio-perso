# Summary

I followed the course on Udemy "Javascript : the weird parts" and I will review my main impressions of this course.

# Course Objectives

I got recommended to do the course by a fellow software developer.
It was great, a few months after the bootcamp, to go back to the basics of Javascript and try to understand a bit more about the situation.
